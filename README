NAME
    libsyslogpp - C++ wrapper for standard syslog interface

SYNOPSIS
    #include <syslogpp.h>
    Link with -lsyslogpp or with -lsyslogpp -lpthread if you build library with multi-threading support.

    For defining keywords you can put them to config.h file and define HAVE_CONFIG_H keyword or set to make flags manually. For including standard syslog mechanism define HAVE_SYSLOG keyword. (else you should provide your owns syslog functions same as openlog, closelog, syslog, setlogmask )

    libsyslogpp is a thread-safe library. Library provides a buffer for each thread. These messages don't mix up in output sequence it is guaranteed. If your program use more than one thread, define HAVE_PTHREAD keyword to enable thread-safe mechanism.

    class syslog_t:
        protected syslogbuf,
        public std::ostream
    {
    public:
    inline                  syslog_t(int prio = LOG_WARNING);
    inline                  ~syslog_t();

    //change priority operator
    inline  std::ostream&   operator () (int prio);

    //standart interface
    inline  void            open(const char* procname, int option, int facility);
    inline  void            close();
    inline  int             setmask(int mask);
    inline  void            operator () (int prio, const char* fmt, ...) const;
    };

STANDARD INTERFACE
    Standart interface contains overriding of the standard syslog definition and preserves the compatibility with standard interface:

    syslog.open( "name", LOG_PID, LOG_DAEMON );
    syslog.setmask( LOG_UPTO( LOG_DEBUG ) );
    syslog( LOG_DEBUG, "%s", "test message" );
    syslog.close();

STREAM INTERFACE
    syslog class derived from std::ostream and provide a standard stream interface:
    syslog << "test message" << std::endl;

    Synchronization is called automatically by any standard handler for which it's specific (std::endl, std::flush) or by directed call of method flush(); Data which has been redirected to syslog remain in buffer till synchronization. 

    You should call operator () for change of a message's priority:
    syslog( LOG_DEBUG );

    All messages will be send to syslog with current priority until the last one won't be changed.

    You can mix changing of messages priority and data redirection: 
    syslog( LOG_DEBUG ) << "test message" << std::endl;

    The change priority operator can flush buffer and transmit data to syslog with previous priority.
    syslog( LOG_DEBUG ) << "message1";
    syslog( LOG_NOTICE ) << "message2" << std::endl;

    You can substitute standard behavior of the predetermined stream output object same as std::cout, std::cerr and std::clog:
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <iostream>
    #include <syslogpp.h>

    int main(int argc, char* argv[])
    {
    syslog.open( NULL, LOG_PID, LOG_USER );
    syslog( LOG_ERR );
    std::clog.rdbuf( syslog.rdbuf() );
    std::clog << "test message" << std::endl;
    syslog.close();
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }

    The substitution of std::cerr isn't recommended, because it hasn't buffering and sends each message separately.
